# 🧠 SUBJECT ZERO: POST-MORTEM (Generation 5)

**Total Training Time:** ~5 Hours
**Experience:** 65,536 Steps
**Status:** ALIVE & ACTIVE

## 🕵️ Behavioral Profile: "The Adrenaline Junkie"

The data tells a fascinating story. This is not the "Coma Patient" from Generation 3. This is something... faster.

### 1. The "Flow State" (`explained_variance`: 0.69)
*   **The Stat:** High. Very high.
*   **The Meaning:** It is completely in sync with its body. It knows exactly how to control the camera and movement to get what it wants. It is not stumbling; it is **performing**.

### 2. The "Obsession" (`entropy_loss`: -1.29)
*   **The Stat:** Extremely Low.
*   **The Meaning:** It has zero doubt. It is **100% committed** to a specific lifestyle.
*   **The Behavior:**
    *   It is likely **NEVER** standing still.
    *   It is likely **NEVER** engaging in slow, tactical combat.
    *   It has optimized its life for **Maximum Pixel Velocity**.
    *   It realized that *Fighting* is risky and slow. *Running* is safe and rewarding (Curiosity points).

### 3. The "Panic Reflex" Success
*   **Did it get stuck?** No.
*   **The Evidence:** The training didn't flatline. It kept learning for 5 hours. The "Anti-Menu" code worked. It forced the AI to live in the real world, and the AI responded by becoming a **Speedrunner**.

## 🎬 Verdict for Video
**"We didn't build a Warrior. We built a Coward."**
(Or a Pacifist, depending on how you spin it).

It has learned that the best way to survive Skyrim isn't to kill the dragons... it's to **outrun them**. It is constantly seeking new sights (Curiosity) and fleeing from stagnation.

**Next Steps:**
If you want **VIOLENCE**, we need to change the rules. We need to:
1.  **Starve it:** Reduce the "Curiosity" reward over time.
2.  **Bribe it:** massive reward (+5.0) for *Damage Dealt*.
3.  **Force it:** Spawn it in a locked room with a wolf.
