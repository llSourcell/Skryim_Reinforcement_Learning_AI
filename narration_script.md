# Reinforcement Learning Animation Script

## Scene 1: The Void & The Agent
**Visual**: A dark void. A glowing sphere (The Agent) appears.
**Text Overlay**: "Meet the Agent."
**Narration (Optional)**: "In the world of Artificial Intelligence, we start with an entity capable of making decisions. We call this... the Agent."

## Scene 2: The Environment
**Visual**: The grid and obstacles materialize around the agent. The Goal appears in the distance.
**Text Overlay**: "The Environment."
**Narration**: "The Agent doesn't exist in a vacuum. It lives in an Environment. A world of rules, obstacles, and objectives."

## Scene 3: The Loop (State -> Action -> Reward)
**Visual**: 
1. **Observation**: A cone of light scans from the agent.
   - **Text**: "1. Observation (State)"
   - **Narration**: "First, the Agent observes its surroundings. It sees where it is, where the walls are, and where the goal lies. This is the State."

2. **Action**: Arrows appear. The agent chooses one.
   - **Text**: "2. Action"
   - **Narration**: "Based on what it sees, the Agent takes an Action. It moves."

3. **Reward**: The agent moves and gets a small penalty (or reward).
   - **Text**: "3. Reward"
   - **Narration**: "Every action has a consequence. A Reward. Or in this case, a small penalty for taking time. This feedback loop is the heart of Reinforcement Learning."

## Scene 4: Learning
**Visual**: Fast-forward. The agent fails, hits walls (red flashes), then resets. Slowly, a glowing trail forms the optimal path.
**Text Overlay**: "Trial & Error -> Learning"
**Narration**: "At first, the Agent knows nothing. It tries, fails, and tries again. But with each attempt, it learns. It updates its internal map of what leads to reward and what leads to failure."

## Scene 5: Success
**Visual**: The agent glides perfectly along the optimal path to the goal. Explosion of gold light.
**Text Overlay**: "Optimal Policy Found"
**Narration**: "Eventually, the Agent discovers the best possible strategy. The Optimal Policy. It has mastered its environment."
