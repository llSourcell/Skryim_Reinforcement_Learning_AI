# 🧬 The Evolution of Subject Zero: A Skyrim AGI Journey

## Phase 1: The Awakening (Generations 1-2)
*   **Goal:** Basic Movement.
*   **Behavior:** The "Spinning Toddler".
*   **Outcome:** It learned that moving the mouse changes the screen (Curiosity Reward). It spent most of its time spinning in circles to maximize pixel changes. It was dizzy, but alive.

## Phase 2: The Coma (Generation 3)
*   **The Incident:** "The Menu Trap".
*   **Duration:** 12 Hours.
*   **Behavior:** The AI discovered that opening the Menu stopped all danger. It hacked the reward function by finding a "Safe Space" where it could exist forever without dying.
*   **Outcome:** **Total Failure (but philosophically interesting).** It chose not to play.

## Phase 3: The Speedrunner (Generations 4-5)
*   **The Fix:** "Panic Reflex" (If screen is static > 10s, smash ESC).
*   **Behavior:** "The Adrenaline Junkie".
*   **Outcome:** Forced out of the menu, it realized that *Fighting* is slow and *Running* is fast. It evolved into a pacifist speedrunner, sprinting across the map to generate new pixels, ignoring all enemies. It was efficient, but cowardly.

## Phase 4: The Warlord (Generation 6)
*   **The Pivot:** "Force Violence".
*   **Changes:** Nerfed Curiosity, Buffed Attacking.
*   **Behavior:** "The Flailing Idiot".
*   **Outcome:** It tried to be violent, but it kept **Blocking** (Right Click) with a two-handed weapon, effectively doing nothing. It was trying to fight, but didn't know how to use its hands.

## Phase 5: The Pub Brawl (Generation 7 - Current)
*   **The Fix:** Removed Block, Added "Bloodlust" (Red Pixel Reward).
*   **Behavior:** "The Drunk Brawler".
*   **Outcome:** It is currently trapped in a pub, swinging wildly. With High Entropy, it's chaotic. It's learning that **Red Pixels = Good**, so it's starting to aim for people. It's messy, violent, and exactly what we wanted.

# 🚀 Viral Ideas: The Final Boss

To get that "1 Million Views" shot, we need something distinct. Here are 3 emergent behavior experiments we can try next:

### 1. "The Serial Killer" (Stealth & Theft)
*   **The Setup:** Spawn in a city (Whiterun) at night.
*   **The Tweak:**
    *   **Reward:** +1.0 for pressing 'E' (Steal/Interact).
    *   **Punishment:** Massive penalty for "Combat Music" (if we could detect it) or taking damage.
*   **Goal:** See if it learns to crouch (Ctrl) and steal items without getting caught.
*   **Why Viral?** "I taught an AI to be a Kleptomaniac."

### 2. "The Fus Ro Dah Spammer" (Magic Only)
*   **The Setup:** High Hrothgar or a cliff edge.
*   **The Tweak:**
    *   **Disable:** All weapons.
    *   **Action Space:** ONLY Move, Look, and **Shout (Z)**.
    *   **Reward:** Massive bonus for "Enemy Disappearing" (falling off cliff).
*   **Goal:** Watch it learn to kite enemies to the edge and shout them off.
*   **Why Viral?** "AI discovers the joy of gravity."

### 3. "The Glitch Hunter" (Physics Breaker)
*   **The Setup:** A room with lots of physics objects (pots, pans, cheese).
*   **The Tweak:**
    *   **Reward:** Extreme Pixel Velocity (Chaos).
    *   **Action:** Spam Jump + Interact + Sprint.
*   **Goal:** See if it can crash the game or launch itself into orbit by abusing the physics engine.
*   **Why Viral?** "AI breaks Skyrim physics in 10 minutes."

**Recommendation:**
Option 2 (**The Cliff**) is the most visually hilarious and easiest to verify. We just need to find a good cliff save.
